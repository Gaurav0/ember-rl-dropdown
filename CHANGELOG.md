# Ember-rl-dropdown change log

## 0.3.0

Dropdowns should now close when pressing the Escape key. This can be disabled by setting `closeOnEscape` to `false`.

The `clickoutEventNamespace` option has been renamed to `closingEventsNamespace`.

## 0.2.0

Upgraded to ember-cli 0.2.x.

## 0.1.0

Added `type='button'` to dropdown toggles with button tags, to prevent IE from treating it like a submit button when
this is not intended.
